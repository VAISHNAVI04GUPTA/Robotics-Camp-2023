# Introduction to Machine Learning
## What is Machine Learning?
Well, according to Arthur Samuel, *Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.* (1959)</br>
Basically, The goal is that we train the Machine in such a way that its able to perform tasks on its own. It is one of the three main branches of Artificial Intelligence, others being Computer Vision/ Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
</br>
Machine Learning basically deals with analytical data and algorithms.

## Some Examples of the Tasks...
- Suppose you have to predict housing prices, given you have the prices of some random houses with varying features such as no. of rooms, area of the flat, etc.
This type of problems, which have to predict continuous valued output (As price can be any number) is known as Regression Problem.
- Suppose you have to predict whether a given image is of a dog or a cat, given you have photos of some already classified images of dogs and cats.
This type of problems, which have to predict discrete valued output (As the picture can be wither dog or cat) is known as Classification Problem. </br></br>
## Machine Learning In a Brief
The above problems are tackled by creating a **ML Model**. A Model is an architecture which uses up some algorithm to extract useful information from the **data**, e.g- the prices of the house already given.
These ML algorithms can be further divided into two segments -</br>
- **Supervised Learning**- These algorithms are designed to train the data which has been labeled for a particular output.
- **Unsupervised Learning**- These algorithms aee designed to train the data which are neither classified nor labeled. The algorithms generally try to identify a pattern in the input data points.

We'll be learning some supervised learning algorithms this week.
